# Github Tutorial
Learning to use version control is absolutely essential for a programmer. If you are not using some kind of version control system already, then you should immediately start using one. Version control ensures that you can always retrieve an older version of your code in case you need to retrieve some code you have deleted. Storing your repositories in the cloud ensures that you won't lose your code, which should be one of your most precious possessions. 

Git is the preferred tool for many developers because it handles distributed version control (Links to an external site.) so well. Outside of university projects, it is most common to work on teams when writing code, so a tool like Git that provides easy collaboration is required. It is quickly becoming a de facto standard so it is useful to understand at least its basics. Git is supported by most online software repositories, like GitHub (Links to an external site.) and BitBucket (Links to an external site.).

##Github Basics
In this tutorial, we are going to show you the minimum subset of Github commands that are necessary to complete the lab for this week.  This [tutorial](gitadvanced.md) will give you a deeper understaning of the more advanced Github features if you have time to explore.
