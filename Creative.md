# Working Together on Creative Projects
You will want to have a shared code base for your creative projects.  
Although you could email a zip file back and forth, you will run into a 
lot of problems and it will be difficult to recover when something breaks.

When you put your code into a github project, you can each check out the 
current version and check in versions that your partner can see.

This tutorial will give you the basics, but there are a lot of other features 
that we will go over as the semester progresses.

To get started, create a new repository, call it "githubtest".  Add a Readme.md file and make it visible to the public so that the TAs can grade it.
